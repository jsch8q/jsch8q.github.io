**The main page is still under constuction; especially, I can't find a decent profile picture to use. I will at least try to keep other sections up to date.**

I am an integrated M.S./Ph.D. student in the <a href='https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/'>Department of Mathematical Sciences, KAIST</a>. 
My academic advisor is Prof. <a href='https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/~donghwankim'>Donghwan Kim</a>.
Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in <a href='https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/'>Mathematical Sciences</a> with minoring <a href='https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/'>Computer Science</a> in KAIST. 

I study optimization theory and algorithms for machine learning. 
Recently, I also got interested in how optimization methods work in real world machine learning applications (implicit biases, generalization properties, etc.). 
If you are interested in collaborating with me, or if you want to know more about anything that is on this website, feel free to contact me by email. 

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
