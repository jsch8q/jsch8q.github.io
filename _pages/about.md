**The main page is still under constuction. Other sub-pages are more complete than the main page, so you can either check those pages, or come back later.**

I am an integrated M.S./Ph.D. student in the <a href='https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/'>Department of Mathematical Sciences, KAIST</a>. 
My academic advisor is Prof. <a href='https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/~donghwankim'>Donghwan Kim</a>.
Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in <a href='https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/'>Mathematical Sciences</a> with minoring <a href='https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/'>Computer Science</a> in KAIST. 

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
