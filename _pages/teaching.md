## MATLAB

I have been appointed as the MATLAB teaching assistant for two and a half years in the KAIST first-year undergraduate course MAS109 *Introduction to Linear Algebra*.
MAS109 is a huge course, with approximately 400 students enrolling each semester.  


As a MATLAB TA, I had to organize MATLAB sessions, which consists of:
* teaching how to use MATLAB to students with no prior programming experience, and 
* handing out brand new homework assignments every semester so that students cannot do them by simply copy-pasting existing codes. 

Because I had to manage both these tasks all by myself, the teaching part was done by recording videos and uploading them to the course website. 
For the assignments, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-grader.html">MATLAB Grader</a>, an online grading platform for MATLAB codes provided by The MathWorks, Inc., helped me a lot.   

Here are the slides I have used in the lecture videos.
