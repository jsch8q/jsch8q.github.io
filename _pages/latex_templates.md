An ongoing—and possibly never ending—project I have been working on since the beginning of my graduate studies is to make myself a LaTeX beamer template.  
  
It is constructed based on the Boadilla theme, with some finetuning done towards mathematical presentations. 
Also, the overall color scheme is based on the <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/html/kaist/011901.html">KAIST identity colors</a>, so that I can represent my affiliation whenever I get to give a presententation. 

Here is the latest version of the <a href="/assets/latex/beamerthemeKAIST.sty">LaTeX style file</a> of the beamer template I made, as of July 1st, 2024. 

Here is a sample of the <a href="/assets/latex/latest.pdf">presentation slides</a> using the beamer template. To reproduce the sample slides, download the <a href="/assets/latex/latest.tex">main TeX file</a>, the <a href="/assets/latex/my_macros.sty">macro file</a>, and the necessary <a href="/assets/latex/biblio_public.bib">bibliography file</a>, place everything including the beamer style file in the same directory, and then compile the main TeX file.
